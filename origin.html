                    <p>Coffee’s story begins in the ancient highlands of Ethiopia, where a young goat herder named Kaldi noticed something unusual. His goats would wander near clusters of bright red berries, eat them, and suddenly become energetic—jumping, pacing, refusing sleep. Curious, Kaldi tried the berries himself and felt a warm rush of alertness.
                        He brought the mysterious fruit to a nearby monastery. The monks at first dismissed it and even threw the berries into the fire… but as they burned, the aroma was so rich and inviting that they couldn’t resist trying again. Soon, they were brewing the berries into a drink that helped them stay awake during long hours of night prayer.
                        Whether the story is fact or legend, Ethiopians have always believed that coffee was discovered with wonder, curiosity, and community—values that still live at the heart of Ethiopian coffee culture.

                    <p>Ethiopia is the botanical birthplace of Arabica coffee, and more than 6,000 wild coffee varieties still grow naturally in its forests. Coffee isn’t just a crop here—it’s part of the land’s identity.
                        For centuries, families living in regions like Kaffa, Sidama, Harar, and Yirgacheffe harvested coffee cherries by hand. These weren’t plantations—they were forest gardens, where coffee grew under natural shade, surrounded by herbs, honeybees, spices, and tall native trees.
                        The connection between the environment and the crop runs deep. People often say coffee “chooses its people,” meaning that when grown with respect, the plant rewards communities with livelihood, tradition, and unity.

                    <p>By the 1400s, Ethiopian traders were sharing coffee with merchants crossing the Red Sea into Yemen. Sufi monks in Yemen quickly embraced the drink for spiritual focus and introduced the first version of modern coffee roasting.
                        From the port of Mocha (yes—the one the drink is named after), coffee traveled to the Middle East, then Europe, then the rest of the world.
                        But even as coffee spread globally, Ethiopia remained its cultural heart. Here, coffee was not consumed casually—it became the center of ceremony, hospitality, and storytelling. Even today, Ethiopians believe coffee is best when shared, and a home is considered warm when the aroma of roasted beans welcomes visitors.

                    <p>Despite becoming a global industry worth billions, Ethiopian coffee still stays connected to its roots. The country is one of the only places where most coffee is still grown, harvested, dried, and sorted by hand.
                        Farmers pass down knowledge through generations—how to identify ripe cherries, how to dry beans on raised beds, and how to recognize flavors unique to each region.
                        Today, Ethiopia continues to produce some of the world’s most sought-after specialty coffees. But what makes it special isn’t only the taste. It’s the heritage, the ritual, and the belief that coffee is a bridge between people, memories, and moments.
